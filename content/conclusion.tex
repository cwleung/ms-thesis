In this paper, we proposed a topic model with transformer embedding. The result has shown a better performance in returning high quality topics compared with other state-of-the-art models. Our model also demonstrates a capability in classifying substantial number of topics.

Their are more improvement to the models. First, Nonparametric Bayesian method did not consider in the research due to the time limitation. Also, since graph model and document shares similarity on power law, we expect to explore the possibility to use graph machine learning knowledge to work with the model.
